# Cart-Abandonment-WooCommerce
CartRebound plugin for WooCommerce - Cart Abandonment emails

CartRebound is a cart abandonment tool for WooCommerce. 

We send out scheduled emails to potential customers who have left items in a cart in your store, to encourage them back to make a purchase.

To get up and running with CartRebound, you need to create an account (over at https://www.cartrebound.com/signup). 

CartRebound is free for life when you're recovering <$10,000 sales per month.

Once you've got an account, install this plugin on your WooCommerce store and you're good to go.
